# Hedgey Periphery Contracts
Smart Contracts that leverage the Core Contracts - building blocks on top of the core contracts.  

These contracts are examples of lego blocks that can build on top of the core Hedgey NFTs infrastructure. They include batch minting for token distribution, an NFTClaimer contract to allow easier management for a long list of whitelisted or tokengated users to claim NFTs from a DAO.   

These contracts are not audited, but may be deployed across multiple networks for case by case uses.
